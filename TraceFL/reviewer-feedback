Hello @ibrahim-Cypher10, thanks for opening this PR for TraceFL! I did a first pass through the code but I'm a bit confused about the FLSimulation class and all the functionality built around it. What is it for and is it used? (1) in the ClientApp it's defined but not used from what I can tell; (2) in the ServerApp it's defined but then only the strategy is used (which is passed to the return statement of server_fn). So i'm wondering if we can remove FLSimulation.

I also left other comments below. Likely the most important is that it's not clear for a reader going through the readme what would be the results (plots/figures) to be able to generate when running each of the commands you indicate later. I suggested looking at how for example FedProx or FedRep or StatAvg -- or others.

The --- should got to the top of the REAMDE.md just before the title. Else the rendering of the readme will fail: see it in your branch: https://github.com/ibrahim-Cypher10/flower/tree/main/baselines/tracefl

```bash
flwr run . --run-config exp_2

Baselines often show a table or plot of the results one should expect when running the flwr run commands indicated. Fore example see how FedProx does it. it also provides the script or notebook to load the results and make the plots.

Based on the "what's implemented" paragraph at the top of the readme, here i'd expect to see Figs 2,3,5 and table 3 with the results the code in the PR generates.

This is a very big file. Are all models and functions used?

I believe Hydra isn't being used, therefore we can remove it

what is this for ? sim doesn't seem to be used after these lines.

formatting wasn't correct. Could you also choose 3 or 4 among those labels?
